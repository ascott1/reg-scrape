reg-scrape
==========

A command line tool written in [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) to scrape the US Code of Federal Regulations.

The current implementation was written on a short Amtrak ride.

## How

Clone this repo and run `node index.js` to scrape the current year's regulations as plain text.

You can also pass an optional argument to scrape the regulations from a certain year (1996-present): `node index.js 2010`.
